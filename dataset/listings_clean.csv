We love this wonderful city so much that we decided to quit our old jobs, and follow our childhood dream, which was to build up our own business and help out visitors to have a wonderful experience in this magnificent city we were lucky enough to be born in.

As such, back in 2017, we decided to create our company Outstanding Nests and our brand Nest@Lisbon, which offers top-shelf accommodations in prime locations. We started step-by-step, but we’re now managing a total of 15+ apartments, and we’ve hosted 10k+ Guests and 2k+ stays – and hearing the feedback from our amazing Guests couldn’t make us prouder.
